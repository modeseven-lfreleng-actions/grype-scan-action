# 🔎 Grype Scan Action

Scans SBOMs, container images or directories for known vulnerabilities
with [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype), renders the findings as
a table in the job step summary, and decides whether they gate the
workflow.

Replaces the Grype shell that each workflow family carried
separately. A fix or an improvement now lands once.

## Why the summary matters

A failing scan used to report a bare count, leaving the affected
packages in the job log. This action puts the findings on the run
page, sorted by severity then risk:

## Grype Vulnerability Scan: alpine:3.10

🔴 Critical: 8  🟠 High: 67  🟡 Medium: 42  🔵 Low: 4

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 MD060 -->

| Severity    | Package      | Version   | Type | Vulnerability  | Fix       | EPSS   | Risk  |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------- | ---- | -------------- | --------- | ------ | ----- |
| 🔴 Critical | libcrypto1.1 | 1.1.1k-r0 | apk  | CVE-2021-3711  | unknown   | 87.82% | 77.5  |
| 🔴 Critical | zlib         | 1.2.11-r1 | apk  | CVE-2022-37434 | -         | 17.85% | 16.78 |
| 🔴 Critical | apk-tools    | 2.10.6-r0 | apk  | CVE-2021-36159 | 2.10.7-r0 | 2.64%  | 2.39  |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 MD060 -->

EPSS is the probability of exploitation in the next 30 days; Risk is
Grype's combined score. The **Fix** column distinguishes a finding you
can act on (a version) from one you cannot (`not-fixed`, `unknown`).

## Usage

Scan an SBOM:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

```yaml
- uses: lfreleng-actions/grype-scan-action@v1
  with:
    sbom: "sbom-cyclonedx.json"
    fail-on: "medium"
```

Scan a set of SBOMs, one report each, worst result deciding:

```yaml
- uses: lfreleng-actions/grype-scan-action@v1
  with:
    sbom: "sbom-cyclonedx-*.json"
```

Scan an image or directory directly:

```yaml
- uses: lfreleng-actions/grype-scan-action@v1
  with:
    target: "registry:alpine:3.20"
    name: "base image"
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD046 -->

## Unblocking a pull request

A published advisory with no available fix can block every pull request
in a repository until upstream ships a patch. There are three ways out,
in order of preference.

### 1. Gate on what a bump can fix

`only-fixed: "true"` reports every finding but gates those with a
fix available. A CVE nobody can action stops blocking merges, while a
missed dependency bump still fails.

The action applies this itself rather than passing `--only-fixed` to
Grype, which would drop unfixable findings from the report altogether.
Measured against `alpine:3.10`: all 121 findings stay in the summary
and the counts, while 1 fixable finding decides the verdict. Use
`ignore-states` where filtering the report itself is what you want.

### 2. Approve a bypass for one vulnerability

Open an issue titled `BYPASS: CVE-2026-12345`, then have a maintainer
apply the `cve-bypass` label. The action suppresses that vulnerability
and records the suppression in the summary, linking the issue.

The **label is the trust boundary**, not the issue author. Applying a
label needs triage or write permission, so an outside contributor
cannot approve their own bypass, while anyone may still request one.

The label authorises a **revision**, not the issue. An author can edit
their own title at any time, so an approved `BYPASS: CVE-2026-0001`
could otherwise become a critical, unfixed CVE after review. The action
reads identifiers from the title as it stood when the label last went
on, reconstructed from the issue's rename events. Editing the title
afterwards changes nothing; a maintainer re-applies the label to
approve the new wording. Where that title cannot be established, the
bypass does not apply.

Authorship plays no part, by design. GitHub's `author_association`
reports `CONTRIBUTOR` rather than `MEMBER` when organisation membership
is private, and the value changes with the token used to read it. That
makes it unsafe as an authorisation signal.

This works where repository variables do not. Pull requests from forks
and Dependabot runs get a read-only token and no Actions secrets,
but reading labelled issues on a public repository needs neither.

Point a group of repositories at one bypass list for organisation-wide
suppression:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

```yaml
- uses: lfreleng-actions/grype-scan-action@v1
  with:
    sbom: "sbom-cyclonedx.json"
    bypass-repository: "lfreleng-actions/.github"
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD046 -->

Bypasses expire. `bypass-max-age-days` (90 by default) makes the action
ignore stale issues, which stops suppressions accumulating unnoticed.
Close the issue to revoke one at once.

A failed lookup, for any reason, applies no bypasses and leaves the
gate closed.

Checking the approved revision costs at least one extra API call per
unexpired bypass issue, and up to ten where the issue has a long
event history. Pass `github-token` where the list is long enough for
unauthenticated rate limits to bite.

### 3. Report without gating

`permit-fail: "true"` reports findings and passes regardless. Wire it
to a repository variable to keep the existing escape hatch:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

```yaml
permit-fail: ${{ vars.NO_BLOCK_AUDIT_FAIL == 'true' }}
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD046 -->

A composite action cannot read the `vars` context itself, so the caller
passes the value.

## Failing closed

A pattern matching no SBOM fails the step by default. Scanning nothing
looks identical to scanning something clean, so a mistyped path, or an
earlier step that failed to produce its SBOM, would otherwise pass a
security gate in silence. Set `fail-on-missing-sbom: "false"` where an
absent SBOM is a valid outcome, such as a build permitted to fail.

The same principle governs the bypass lookup: an API error applies no
bypasses rather than assuming approval, and so does an issue whose
approved title cannot be reconstructed.

## Notes

The gate is computed from the JSON report rather than from Grype's
`--fail-on` exit code, because bypasses have to be subtracted from the
findings first. An exit code cannot express "these would gate, but a
maintainer suppressed two of them". Deriving the table, the counts and
the verdict from one source keeps them consistent.

A Grype configuration file taken from a pull request head is
attacker-controlled: a contributor can add ignore rules to their own
branch. Prefer bypass issues, which live outside the branch under
review. Trust `config` when it comes from the base repository.
